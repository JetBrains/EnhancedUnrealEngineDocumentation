# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0). Note that this project does not follow
semantic versioning but uses version numbers based on JetBrains [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) releases.

The EnhancedUnrealEngineDocumentation plugin adds a convenient way to get improved documentation for Unreal Engine reflection specifiers provided by [BenUI](https://twitter.com/_benui) right in the [Rider IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
